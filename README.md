📘 Python Quiz Game (January 21st - 22nd 2026)
This is my first GitHub project, made while learning Python.
It’s a simple command-line quiz game that tests basic Python knowledge with:

• Easy mode
• Hard mode
• Score system
• User input.

I built this project to practice and memorize Python concepts while coding.

🧠 What I practiced in this project
• print()
• input()
• Variables
• If / elif / else statements
• String methods
• Basic math
• Simple logic

▶️ How I run the project
• I run this file using my code editor (Pycharm) by pressing Run.

📚 Learning source
• I Learned the Python concepts used in this project from Bro Code's Python Course on YouTube

🚀 Future plans
• Clean up the code
• Add more structure as I learn Python
